✅ READY TO COPY/PASTE: FULL OFFER STACK (UPDATED)

Here’s the complete offer stack, updated with your Fixers Council distinction:

⸻

💥 The Truth Hurts!
In 1958, $2.50/hour could buy a house, car, food, and raise a family.
Today? You’d need $70/hour just to match that buying power — and we still call it “progress.”

We’re exposing the lie. And fixing what’s broken.
Join us — and fuel the mission to end systemic homelessness and economic injustice.
